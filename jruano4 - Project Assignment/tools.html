                <h2>What Tools Will You Need?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are a few tools that you will need to make matcha. The first tool is a bowl, this is where you will mix the matcha powder with water. The second tool is a sifter, this will help to break up any clumps in the matcha powder. The third tool is a bamboo whisk or frother, this will help to mix the matcha and water together until it is frothy. Finally, you will need a cup to pour your matcha into.

                <h3>Bamboo Whisk</h3>

                    <p>
                        The bamboo whisk is the traditional tool used to prepare matcha. It has many bristles attached to the handle, this helps to create a frothy texture when whisking the matcha powder with water. The whisk is typically soaked in warm water before use to soften the bristles, making it easier to whisk the matcha.The bamboo whisk is essential for achieving the perfect frothy texture in your matcha. It allows you to whisk the matcha powder and water together, creating a smooth and creamy consistency.

                        A frother is an electric tool that can be used to whisk matcha powder and water together. It is a convenient alternative to the bamboo whisk, especially if you are short on time or prefer a more modern approach. The frother creates a frothy texture similar to that of the bamboo whisk, making it easy to prepare matcha quickly.
